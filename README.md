Predictive Model of Motion Picture Success using Machine Learning Algorithms

Description: <br>
The large volume of data has aroused interest in the study and development of algorithms that
use them to draw conclusions. The role of data analysis and pattern finding has been taken by
the data mining and machine learning scientific branches. The subject of diploma is a database of
motion pictures analysis to predict their success (predicting their score) using machine learning
algorithms. For this work a database of graded films from the IMDb website and a database related
to the oscar winners for actors and directors were used. The problem was approached in three
ways. Initially, the data were analyzed and through the graphs the conclusion was drawn that the
actors, the directors, the type of film and the analysis of the image are the factors that influence
whether a film is successful or not. Following the first approach, the method of analyzing the
principal components was applied, through which new features were created, a combination of the
initial ones, and it seemed to improve the percentage of the correct prediction. Finally, another
approach was taken in which the actors, directors and the plot keywords were taken as features and
in combination with the database of the Oscars, the effort was made to better and more accurately
classify these features. Thus, the classification was made by combining some factors and studying
the coefficients of these factors. The results of the third approach showed that they are close with
those of the second.
